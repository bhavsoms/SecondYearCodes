# Operating System
Operating Systems Experiments: 
This repository contains source code for various experiments conducted in your Operating Systems (OS) course.

Experiments:

# Scheduling Algorithms:
- FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve): This code simulates the FCFS scheduling algorithm, where processes are executed based on their arrival time.
- RR (Round Robin): This code implements the RR scheduling algorithm, which allocates a time slice (quantum) to each process before preempting it and moving on to the next in the queue.
# Memory Management:
- Hit and Miss Page Replacement: This code simulates a paging system with page replacement algorithms like FIFO (First-In, First-Out) or LRU (Least Recently Used) to handle page faults.
# Inter-Process Communication (IPC):
- Consumer-Producer Problem using Forking: This code implements the consumer-producer problem using fork() to create child processes. Semaphores or mutexes are used for synchronization between the producer and consumer processes.
# Directory Management:
- This code explores data structures and algorithms for managing directory structures in file systems, potentially including techniques for storing and organizing file names, attributes, and directory hierarchies.
