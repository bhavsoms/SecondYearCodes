## Image Processing Experiments: A Summary


* **Image Negative & Gray Level Slicing**
- * **Image Negative:** This technique inverts the intensity values of an image, essentially creating a photographic negative. Bright areas become dark, and vice versa.
- * **Gray Level Slicing:** This technique manipulates the distribution of pixel intensities in an image. By selecting specific gray level ranges, you can enhance certain features or remove unwanted information.

* **MRI Image Segmentation**

This experiment delves into a more advanced image processing task: **MRI Image Segmentation**. Segmentation aims to identify and classify distinct objects or regions within an image. In this case, you likely focused on segmenting various tissues or structures in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan. This segmentation can be crucial for medical diagnosis and analysis.

* **Edge Detection**

This experiment explores the concept of **Edge Detection**. Edges represent boundaries between different objects or regions in an image. Detecting edges allows you to extract meaningful information about shapes and objects within the image. Edge detection techniques are widely used in various applications like object recognition, motion analysis, and image compression.

* **Image Smoothing & Image Sharpening**

This experiment investigates two contrasting image enhancement techniques:

* **Image Smoothing:** This technique aims to reduce noise and blur unwanted image details. Smoothing filters often utilize averaging techniques to blend neighboring pixel values.
* **Image Sharpening:** This technique enhances edges and high-frequency details within an image. Sharpening filters often emphasize differences between neighboring pixel values, making edges appear more prominent.
