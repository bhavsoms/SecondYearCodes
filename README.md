Experiments: 
This document outlines a series of experiments you've conducted in Artificial Intelligence:

### 8-Puzzle Problem:##
This is a classic problem-solving task in AI. You likely implemented a search algorithm, like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), to find the sequence of moves that transforms a scrambled 8-puzzle tile configuration into the goal state.

### Min-Max Algorithm:###
This algorithm is commonly used for two-player zero-sum games like chess or checkers. You might have explored how Min-Max evaluates game states and selects the optimal move for a player by considering the opponent's potential responses.

### Pathfinding in Maze:###
This experiment involved finding an optimal route (shortest path) through a maze-like environment. Algorithms like A* search or maze solving algorithms tailored for specific maze representations could have been implemented.

### Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP):###
This well-known optimization problem seeks the shortest possible route that visits each city in a given list exactly once and returns to the starting city. You might have experimented with heuristic approaches or approximation algorithms to tackle this computationally expensive problem.

### Water Jug Problem:###
This is a state-space search problem where you have multiple jugs with different capacities and need to reach a specific amount of water in one jug using only the provided operations (fill, empty, pour). You likely implemented a search algorithm to find the sequence of actions to achieve the desired state.
