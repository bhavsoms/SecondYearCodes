# SecondYearCodes
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of source code I developed during my second year of engineering studies in 2023. It encompasses projects completed in core courses, including:

- Analysis of Algorithms: Implementations of various algorithms, focusing on efficiency (time and space complexity) and exploring data structures.
- Image & Video Processing: Code for processing, manipulating, and analyzing images and videos. This may involve techniques like filtering, object detection, feature extraction, etc.
- Artificial Intelligence: Projects related to machine learning, deep learning, or other AI concepts. Specific topics could include neural networks, reinforcement learning, computer vision, etc.
- Operating Systems: Code related to operating system concepts like concurrency, process scheduling, memory management, file systems, etc. (This may vary depending on your curriculum.)
